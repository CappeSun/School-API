# Description

This is a school assignment, where I have created a gloriously pointless tool for creating sounds. You generate made-up genres from genrenator, and when you've found something you want to hear, you press the funky button to get sounds from freesound.

# APIs Used

https://binaryjazz.us/genrenator-api/ (to generate genres and stories)
https://freesound.org/docs/api/ (for all sounds)
